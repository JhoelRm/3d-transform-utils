# 3D Transform Utilities

Small utilities focused on transform resets in 3D software.

## Overview

This repository contains simple transform reset utilities implemented for
Cinema 4D using the Python SDK.

The goal is to provide clean, minimal examples that focus on core transform
behavior rather than UI complexity or full production tooling.

## Contents

- Reset position
- Reset rotation
- Reset scale

Each utility is implemented as a minimal registered tool for Cinema 4D.

## Usage

The tools are intended to be used as reference implementations or lightweight
helpers inside Cinema 4D environments.

Refer to the source code for implementation details.
